# DeepMiRBP: A Hybrid Model for Predicting MicroRNA-Protein Interactions

## Overview
DeepMiRBP is a novel hybrid deep learning model designed to predict microRNA-binding proteins by modeling molecular interactions. The model integrates Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (Bi-LSTM) networks, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), and cosine similarity to offer a robust computational approach for inferring microRNA-protein interactions.
