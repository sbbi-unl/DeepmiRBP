# DeepMiRBP: A Hybrid Model for Predicting MicroRNA-Protein Interactions

## Overview
DeepMiRBP is a novel hybrid deep learning model designed to predict microRNA-binding proteins by modeling molecular interactions. The model integrates Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (Bi-LSTM) networks, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), and cosine similarity to offer a robust computational approach for inferring microRNA-protein interactions.

Usage
First Component: Bi-LSTM and Attention Mechanism
The first component of DeepMiRBP employs Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (Bi-LSTM) networks combined with an attention mechanism. This component encodes RNA sequences and predicts their interactions with RNA-binding proteins (RBPs). The attention mechanism enhances the model's focus on the most relevant features of the sequence, improving prediction accuracy.

Second Component: CNN and Cosine Similarity
The second component processes Position-Specific Scoring Matrices (PSSM) and Protein Structure Contact Maps (PSCM) using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). This component identifies similarities between encoded protein structures and miRNA-binding proteins. Leveraging cosine similarity provides a list of candidate proteins with a high likelihood of binding to the given miRNA.

How to Run the Model
Prepare your data: Ensure your RNA sequences, PSSM, and PSCM data are properly formatted and ready for input.
Train the model: Use the provided scripts to train your RNA sequences' first component (Bi-LSTM and attention).
Generate embeddings: Extract embeddings from the trained model for use in the second component.
Predict interactions: Use the second component (CNN and cosine similarity) to predict miRNA-protein interactions based on the embeddings and structural data.
Example
Detailed examples and scripts for training and prediction will be available in the repository's examples directory.
